<h2>Drosophila flight assay</h2>

<h3>Can also be used for standardizing image capture and experimental details in a particle detection assay</h3>

Originally designed for use in conjunction with Babcock and Ganetzky's "Improved method for accurate and rapid measurement of flight performance in Drosophila" (doi: 10.3791/51223), or any other design that requires 

Scripts are designed to be used with a Raspberry Pi and PiCamera
